I'm a 21 years old Final Year Student at Brunel University, and this is part of my Final Year Project, a demo of the algorithms
used to analyse Mental Health data, gathered from various sources, all cited in the Report. It's quite the amateur job, but I've learned a lot from this experience.               

The only required files to run the app.r are the 4 .rds files, the csv files are samples of synthesized data sets created from one of my own schemas on Mockaroo.com, link to it https://www.mockaroo.com/cb872960.  
          
Thank you for checking this out!
