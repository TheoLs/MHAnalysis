I'm a 21 years old Final Year Student at Brunel University, and this is part of my Final Year Project, a demo of the algorithms
used to analyse Mental Health data, gathered from various sources, all cited in the Report. It's quite the amateur job, but I've learned a lot from this experience.               

The only required files to run the app.r are the 4 .rds files, the csv files are samples of synthesized data sets created from one of my own schemas on Mockaroo.com, link to it https://www.mockaroo.com/cb872960.  
          
Thank you for checking this out!


Known Problems: 
1 - Had an issue - thanks to a stackoverflow user it was fixed, but that lead to the next problem.
2 - The app takes too long to launch on shiny.io, hence if not run locally, this will not work... Am currently trying to resolve this.
